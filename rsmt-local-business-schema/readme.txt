RSMT Tools adds local business schema microdata to a site


== Description ==

An easy way to add schema markup.

Employees and Founders can be added to the microdata by group. Users name, profile url, email, and description are used. This will help with simple searches like "Bakery Chicago Mike", where the person might remember the employee but not where they bought the item.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `rsmt-local-business-schema` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
